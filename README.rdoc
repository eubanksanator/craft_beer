Using BreweryDB API

What our basic functionality will be:

(1) Take an address and and a radius
(2) Then print a Google map with the resulting breweries in that radius
(3) Add your own parameter that the user can choose to narrow down choice (e.g. organic breweries)

Then we can meet and compare our code next Thursday
